#### Intro

Chloe presented an agenda in which any new ideas would be reviewed and then all ideas that were proposed to be worked on for the business model canvas would be presented and voted on. General consensus formed around this agenda. 


#### Ideas

##### Alexander Presented Ideas
Germ Detector: (Voted On)
* Generally well received
* Should be pretty flexible in terms of achievability

Muscle / Workout Assist:
* Suggestions for applications in physical therapy
* Could be integrated in

Smart Mirror / Skin Cancer:
* Caution about providing "medical advice"
* Kinda weird need a way to normalize this.... maybe not a mirror
* Big privacy concerns
* Suggested applications in breast cancer detection as well

##### Chloe Presented Ideas

Symptom guard: (Voted On)
  * Array of sensors to get basic human data when person enters hospital etc.
  * General feeling this was most feasible

Alternative Radiology:
  * Using ultrasonic or infrared to to less intrusive x-ray / diagnosis
  * General feeling this was less feasible

##### Moniques Ideas

AI Physical Therapist:
  * Some system to assist physical therapists
  * Vision system that collects parameters / progress about a patients treatment
  * Headset that uses AR to show ideal / real range of motion etc.
  * Comment that this would primarily be a software project given existing AR tech
  * Comment also that we should not try to implement our own AR system
  * Could be combined with muscle sensing?

Smart Back Stimulator: (Voted On)
  * Identify inflammation / strain using infrared imaging
  * Comment that we (again) should be careful about offering medical advice
  * Question about if you can detect muscle stress via heat (Monique thinks we can just has to be sensitive)
  * Question about how device will relieve tension (Car that rolls on your back or chair attachment / cover)
     * Response that chair would be good idea but robot may not be feasible
     * Suggestion of "blanket" application where heat is detected (inflammation) and then heat is applied to resolve

##### Mark / Keith

Smart Glove: (Voted for Keith)
  * Glove that would assist opening and closing your hand for weak people or people who work in jobs with repetitive tasks
  * Largest problem is inaccessibility of SMA or other mechanical method to help do this

Life Signs Monitor: (Voted for Mark)
  * Did and presented the business canvas

Support Shoe:
  * Dropped the idea (couldn't locate a good enough target market)

#### Final Thoughts
* Will help each other brainstorm about people to call
