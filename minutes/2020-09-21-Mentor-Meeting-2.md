#### Intro

Exchanged bried pleasantries with Luke and then expressed a desire to present lightning pitches and see his feedback on the pitch and any changes to the idea we had made in the past two weeks. General consenus on this model.

Posited going through all pitches first before discussing but Luke expressed a desire to give immediate feedback.

#### Pitches

##### Mark - Life Signs Detector

- First thought is what are you doing to make this cheaper than available solutions
    - Not a full smart watch solution, simple and reliable

##### Monique - Muscle Heat Stimulator
- Commented on how this significantly evolved

##### Chloe - Symptom Guard
- Cautioned on making any specific claims in your pitch (kinda tongue in cheek)

##### Alex - Germ Detector
- Commented on the new idea
- Asked if it was possible
   - Responded talking about research
- Thinks it has a lot of market potential

- Adjourned to further practice pitches

#### Post-Meeting

Luke expressed that he liked all of the ideas and felt they were marketable and possible as they were pitched.

We decided to adjourn early to practice and fine tune pitches before the upcoming lighting pitch presentation class session.
