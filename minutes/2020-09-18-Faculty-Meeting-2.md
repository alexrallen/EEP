#### Intro

Introduced ourselves to Seth Hollar.

Discussed and decided to present our slide deck and get feedback on each idea.

#### Presentation

##### Movement Assist Gloves

* Interview physical therapists or people seeing them
* Differentiate from exoskeleton type configuration that already exists
* Thinks it could be feasible and sellable

##### Smart Life Signs Monitor

* Primary concern is that it might exist in the market and if it doesn't there might be a good reason given the capability companies in the space.
* Worried about the psychology of wearing such a device.
* Growing area of tech that could be good for innovation.
* Might want to think more broadly about life signs monitoring.
* Reliability is a huge factor.

##### Symptom Guard

* Interview nurses and hospitals etc to see how common cross infection is and how much of a problem it poses.
* Be careful about HIPPA and collecting patient info.
* Worried about technical feasibility of taking the presented measurements indirectly / remotely.
* Worried about the cost of install + sensors + service versus the time of a nurse.
* "Seamless measurement of vital signs" is a good idea. Think more about potential applications and form factors.

##### Intelligent Muscle Thermal Stimulator

* Look at other areas than the back?
* Suggests the knee as a common target for pain.

##### Germ Detector

* Be careful about UV light. Safety concern.
* Need to verify technology
* Interview people using the existing device

#### Post-Meeting

General agreement that most feedback had already been considered. Agreement to issue similar presentation to Luke (Plexus Mentor) to get his feedback as well.
