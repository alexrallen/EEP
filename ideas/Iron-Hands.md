title: Iron Hands
---

A pair of electronically controlled gloves that senses intended movement in the fingers and provides extra mechanical force in the same direction.

The force would be translated to the fingers via cables or ribbons on both the inside and outside of the gloves, working in much the same way tendons in fingers do.

Two potential applications:

* The first would be to help rehabilitate people with disease or injury that have limited strength in their hands.

* The other goal is to help people who may suffer strain from holding their hands in certain positions or performing repetitive tasks for long periods.

## Lightning Pitch

Hi my name is Keith. Your hands are your primary interface with the world, think of everything you have picked up, turned, pushed, or pulled today. Imagine every time you did that you were in pain. This is reality for many people today. Arthritis is the single most common disability in older adults, affecting 15% of over 60 year old individuals. With the iron hand gloves we eliminate arthritic stress on joints while applying grip strength comparable to a healthy hand. Give your loved ones the freedom, and dexterity they deserve.
