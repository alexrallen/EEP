## Lightning Pitch

Hi everyone, my name is Chloe. Let me tell you some facts, there's over a 40% chance that everyone in this room will find themselves in a hospital sometime in the next year. In that hospital, one in every 30 patients will contract an unrelated illness, daily. Once infected there is a 1 in 20 chance of that patients death. That could be you. Presenting, symptom guard, a system to detect infectious individuals and protect sick-free areas of hospitals to minimize the risk of cross-infection and ensure every patient can come home to their family.
