# Life Signs Monitor

Wearable device that provides continuous health diagnostics and emergency services or caregiver alerts.

Likely a wrist strap, very limited UI to be extremely simple for the wearer.

Same market segment as medical alert bracelets / pendants but with significantly improved functionality.
Works in more areas.

Can also save significant costs by not staffing call centers.

Provides alerts when patient is NOT capable of communication.

Likely use nb-IOT or lte-m for low power WAN connectivity.

## Lightning Pitch

Hi everyone, my name is Mark and I am presenting a better medical alert device. Traditional alert devices only support basic fall detection and have an expensive support network. I propose a small, inexpensive, cellular device that records a variety of health metrics and can directly alert caregivers or 911 if vital signs fall below acceptable margins. Cheaper, more flexible and more detailed metric allow elderly family members to reclaim freedom without sacrificing safety and security. Thank you.
