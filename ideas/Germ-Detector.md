## Lightning Pitch

Hi everyone, my name is Alexander and I am presenting a contamination detector. One in 31 patients a day contracts a healthcare associated infection accounting for millions of infections and 100,000 deaths annually. These are caused by inadequate sanitation and resistant bacteria which makes detection crucial. Recent research shows that bacteria invisible to the human eye fluoresces at deep UV frequencies. I propose a small handheld detector system to characterize surface contamination in a reusable and accessible fashion for hospitals and the general public for use where cleanliness is essential. Thank you.
