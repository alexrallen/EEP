Any violation of the expectations set by Articles III & IV shall result in a “strike” against a member. Three strikes shall constitute a warning by the rest of the team. Any strike may be waived by majority vote under extenuating circumstances.

Any member or associate who has accrued three or more strikes, has been warned by the team of their misconduct, and continues to fail to meet the expectations set in Articles III & IV shall be eligible for firing by a unanimous vote of the remaining members.

<h3 align="center"> Article III: Regular Operations </h3>

##### Section A: Meetings

A “meeting” for the purpose of this article shall be defined as a scheduled event in which all members and associates are invited to attend. These rules shall not apply to small discussions between individual members and associates.

Meetings shall be established through a majority vote of members. While a unanimous vote is not required to define a meeting, a vote of all mandatory attendees is required to set the date and time per Article III Section B.

All meetings shall have an explicit agenda when proposed so that all attendees are aware of the goals and expectations for the meeting. Agendas for recurring meetings shall be posted at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting time for revision by other members. Failure to do so will result in a “strike” for the designated member per Article II Section D.

Meeting minutes shall be taken at each meeting and shall be published within 24 hours of the meeting. Failure to do so will result in a “strike” for the designated member per Article II Section D.

There shall be at least two mandatory, recurring meetings scheduled per week of at least one hour in duration. Individual sessions of these meetings and all other recurring meetings may be cancelled with a unanimous vote of all attendees.

##### Section B: Scheduling

All meetings set shall be considered mandatory for all members and associates unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Meetings may only be scheduled through unanimous agreement of all mandatory attendees and all meetings must be memorialized with a calendar invite to all attendees. No meeting may be scheduled or rescheduled to within 24 hours of notice being given.

At least 24 hours notice is expected of mandatory attendees who cannot attend a meeting. Absences of a mandatory attendee where adequate notice was not given shall be considered unexcused and will result in a “strike” per Article II Section D unless a valid excuse is presented to the other members. Upon the presentation of an excuse the members may perform a majority vote to waive the attendance requirement if they feel that there were extenuating circumstances.

##### Section C: Roles

For responsibilities within MediEP that are necessary to keep the organization functional on a regular basis there shall be members or associates explicitly assigned to these responsibilities. Responsibilities may be added and removed from this list by majority vote.

There shall be a designated member to take meeting minutes by default at each meeting they are an attendee. (Alexander Allen)

There shall be a designated member to write weekly status update emails required for maintaining contact with our mentor and to also plan topic of discussion for mentor meetings (Monique Reid)

There shall be a designated member to create and publish agendas for recurring meetings unless otherwise specified (Chloe Sanchez-Prado)

There shall be a designated member for tracking EEP deliverables and ensuring that individual members are meeting them (Keith Mellendorf)

There shall be a designated member for communicating with 3rd parties and EEP Faculty members (Mark Funderburk)

There shall be a designated member for maintaining our list of ideas and their statuses (Mark Funderburk)

Failure to execute on these duties as judged by a majority vote shall result in a “strike” per Article II Section D. Ties shall not be considered sufficient to issue a strike.

##### Section D: General Responsibilities and Rules

After each meeting a member or associate may be assigned a task or action item with a specified due date. This task must be completed by the due date or 24 hour notice of non-completion must be given unless otherwise specified.

If a due date is missed and no notification was given within the defined window of time, a strike shall be issued to the responsible person per Article II Section D.

Members and associates are expected to respond to messages directed at them within 12 hours of message transmission unless otherwise specified. Failure to do so will result in a strike being issued to the non-responsive person per Article II Section D.

Members shall not commit the team to any responsibilities or any major decisions without a majority vote of the members. Failure to call a vote for major decisions, as judged by a majority vote, shall result in a “strike” per Article II Section D. Ties shall not be considered sufficient to issue a strike.

MediEP may ONLY commit to a “product” in EEP through a unanimous vote.

##### Section E: Voting

There are two types of votes recognized by MediEP. One is the Unanimous Vote, and the other is the Majority Vote.

For a unanimous vote to pass, all 5 members must affirmatively vote YES.
For a majority vote to pass, at least 3 members must affirmatively vote YES.

##### Section F: Revisions
